# Final Project

## Objective
Build a prototype of an agentic system to be used inside your company. You can utilize graphs, agents, or multi-agent systems.

## Overview of Tasks
1. **Identify Problem:**
Determine a specific problem within your company that could benefit from the application of an agentic system.
2. **Diagram a Solution:**
Create a detailed diagram outlining the proposed solution. This should include the architecture of the agentic system, the roles of different agents, and how they interact to solve the identified problem.
3. **Build Prototype:**
Develop a working prototype based on the diagrammed solution. This initial version doesn't have to be perfect but should demonstrate the core functionality and potential of the agentic system.

## Deliverables
- **Working Prototype:**
A functional prototype of the agentic system. While it doesn't have to be perfect, it should serve as a first pass and clearly illustrate the intended solution.
- **Application of Course Learnings:**
The prototype must incorporate the concepts and techniques learned throughout this course to address a real business problem within your company.
